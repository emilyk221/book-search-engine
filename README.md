  ## Description
  This book search engine app allows users to search for books, login, save their favorite books to their book list, and remove books from their list. Books in the search results and in the saved books lists contain the book title, author(s), a description, and an image of the book. This app's code has been converted from using RESTful APIs to using GraphQL and an Apollo Server. In order to accomplish this, an Apollo Server, along with typeDefs and resolvers were added to the server side and Apollo Provider, along with queries and mutations were added to the client side. Also, the logic on the front end was changed to accomodate a GraphQL endpoint rather than the multiple API endpoints originally.
